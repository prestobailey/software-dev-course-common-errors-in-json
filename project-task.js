üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

// ‚úÖ Requirements

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?

// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?

I went overviewing the JSON content first and marked what I could find, along with VSCode's highlighting in the code editor. After parsing through I used jsonlint.com to mint it.
Then I went back to compare and contrast between the original and mine to then finish the comments. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?

I plugged in my JSON into the linter, this allowed me to double down on my corrections to see if it passed. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?

Honestly the email formatting. My mind went over that issue thinking it was preference, that is where the issue was pointed out and realigned to the preset values. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)

   Learn down syntax for the repective language, you will be the first and line of defence from defunct code. Utilize your hardware such as your IDE if it has a built in 
   higlighting feature. Use linting software to help for the mistakes that slip through the cracks. Repeat the process over and over because we are only human where we
   will make mistakes and sometimes machines do fail as well, but not as much.
